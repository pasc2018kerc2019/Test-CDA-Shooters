## Improves for the future versions of shooters
Due to a lack of time there's some methods i didn't explore :
- Use a decrementation method to adapt the game to be used with differents 
 parameters.
 
 - Revisiting the code and try to condense it more to save storage space 

 - improve the view with some css
